This workshop will explore such questions from the perspective of two different traditional approaches, viz. \u201cmathematical structuralism\u201d and \u201cmathematical fictionalism\u201d. The main objective of the workshop is to re-evaluate these perspectives on the foundations of mathematics within the context of mathematical practice. Specifically, the following research questions will be addressed in the workshop: Do either structuralism or fictionalism offer a philosophically viable foundation for modern mathematics? To what extent are structuralism and fictionalism faithful to mathematical practice? How do mathematicians think about meaning, reference, and truth in mathematics? Where: The Treehouse Humanities Research Centre Berrick Saul Building University of York Heslington York YO10 5DD UK We will also aim to offer online participation.
